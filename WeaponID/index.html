          IDs for teammate shots in On-rails, enemy's chasing teammates in On-rails, touching certain enemies in On-Rails, enemies chasing teammates in Wing Riding weren't obtained
          due to complications. So those could be the missing IDs along with others I may not know about.

          The input box in the Other section is for an additional offset from where the damage value should normally be found at. It changes automatically when
          switching weapons. But if you want to change it manually, you can do so. Only recommended for non-documented IDs. The valid range is from -14 to 40 as
          an increase in id of 1 moves to the next weapons damage value 40 memory address away. The -16 is also valid as damage values are 16 bytes away from the base
          struct, so while you can make overlap as an id of 2 and offset of 30 is the same as an id of 3 with an offset of -10, I wanted to give flexibility to account for this.

          Function for calculating Weapon Damage:<br>
          &emsp;Pilot: 0x1 <br>
          &emsp;Arwing/Wolfen: 0x2 <br>
          &emsp;Landmaster: 0x3 <br>
          &emsp;Enemies: 0x4 <br>
          &emsp;??? (I don't know what's this for): 0x5 <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Weapon IDs 0-37 were originally documented by Jase-Vendor and updated slightly by ModSault. The rest of the IDs were found by ModSault, including hardcoded values.
          If you want to help with any documentation, whether it be for the missing IDs, reporting bugs, or anything else, feel free to do so. My contact information can be found
          on my Youtube Channel's About Me page.
          
          <br><br>
          The method I used to get the hardcoded values mainly involved placing a memory breakpoint on the health of the player/Landmaster/Arwing, taking damage by the hardcoded amount,
          and tracing it back with a gdb like debugger using Dolphin to find where its damage value is saved.

          <br><br>
          As for the Weapon IDs, a function is called when the Pilot/Arwing/Enemy/Landmaster is hit to determine how much damage should be taken. The address of the start of the function are above.
          All you need is a breakpoint on the appropriate function, and then get hit by the attack. Run the first instruction of the function and the register (r0 or r7 as seen on the first instruction of the function)
          will have the ID number of the weapon.
